Simulate 3D geometric transformations using matrix operations.

- Applies rotation, translation, and scaling
- Shows how matrix chains affect object positioning
- Compose or JavaFX UI for visual feedback

## Concepts

- Homogeneous coordinates
- 3D spatial reasoning with matrices

## Run

```bash
./gradlew run
```
