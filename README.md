# Kotlin Linear Lab ⚗️

A monorepo collection of Kotlin-based mini projects that explore and demonstrate the concepts of linear algebra.

Each project serves as a hands-on experiment to understand matrix operations, vector algebra, PCA, 3D transformations, and more — all implemented with pure Kotlin.

## 📂 Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`matrix-calculator`](./matrix-calculator) | Basic & advanced matrix operations (inverse, LU decomposition, etc.) |
| [`linear-algebra-core`](./linear-algebra-core) | Core matrix/vector library for custom operations |
| [`pca-visualizer`](./pca-visualizer) | PCA algorithm with interactive 2D/3D chart |
| [`simple-neuralnet`](./simple-neuralnet) | Neural network from scratch using only matrix math |
| [`3d-transform-sim`](./3d-transform-sim) | 3D rotation/translation simulator using transformation matrices |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Kotlin (JVM)
- Compose for Desktop / JavaFX (UI)
- Gradle (KTS)
- Pure math — no external ML libraries

---

## 💡 Goals

- Practice linear algebra through practical implementation
- Build reusable math components in Kotlin
- Visualize and understand how math powers real-world systems
